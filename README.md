##  CleaningData project

This repository contains:
* The script, which tidies the data proposed in the project3 of the Cleaning and Tidying Data. It is 	called **run_analysis.R**
* The result of the script. Called **tidy_data.csv**
* The code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations: **CodeBook.md**

### How does the script work?
There is only one script which performs all the work. 

1. In the first line of the script the working directory where the data is going to be is specified. The data is supposed to be in the folder named "UCI HAR Dataset"
2. Then the libraries used are loaded. 
3. Finally all the data is tidied.
